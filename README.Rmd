The goal of inteRgrate is to provide an very opinionated set of rules for R package development.
The idea is that when many people contribute to a package, it's easy for standards to diverge. We
think that CI can help here. 
This package has the same functions for both travis and Gitlab-CI environments.
Currently, the package is used by [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com) on GitHub and 
GitLab.

The rationale behind this package is

 * While checking R packages on travis is easy, support for GitLab (and others) is lacking.
 * When developing a package, sometimes we want to specify the exact number of NOTES
 and WARNINGS we expect/allow.
 * Having a consistent system for different CI is desirable.
 * For our CI steps, we have a few other checks that we tend to implement, e.g. lints, not
 using imports within namespaces.
 
This package is still being developed, but we are now actively using it, so hopefully we can
avoid breaking changes.

## Installation

As the package is currently being developed, it isn't yet on CRAN. 
The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jumpingrivers/inteRgrate")
```

## Functions

The package is meant to be used within a continuous integration framework, e.g. travis, GitLab 
runner. This package contains a number functions that are useful for CI:

 * `check_pkg()` - installs package dependencies, builds & installs the package, before 
  running package check. By default, __any__ notes or warnings will raise an error message.
  This can be changed by setting the environment variables `ALLOWED_NOTES` and 
  `ALLOWED_WARNINGS`.
 * `check_lintr()` - runs lintr on the package, README.Rmd and vignettes. 
 * `check_namespace()` - check for instances of `import()` in the NAMESPACE file. By default, 
 no imports are allowed. This can be changed via the environment variable `NO_IMPORTS`
 * `check_r_filenames()` - ensures file extensions are `.R` and all names are lower case.
 * `check_version()` - ensures that the package description has been updated.
 * `check_gitignore()` - .gitignore contains standard files.
 * `check_readme()` - checks README.Rmd timestamps
 * `check_tidy_description()` - ensure that the DESCRIPTION file is tidy, 
 via `usethis::use_tidy_description()`
 * `check_file_permissions()`, `check_line_breaks()` -  ensures that linux line breaks are used and file permissions are
 sensible.
 * `create_tag()` - autotag via the CI.

See the help pages for customisation.

There's also a pre-commit hook to help. Run `inteRgrate::add_pre_commit()` in root git directory
of your repo and checks will be run before committing.

### Example .travis.yml file

Within a CI file, it's often better to use `check_via_env()` that will automatically call all checks.
Specific checks can be switch on/off via environment variables.

```
language: r
cache: packages
env:
  global:
    - ALLOWED_WARNINGS=0
    - ALLOWED_NOTES=0
    - NO_IMPORTS=0

script:
  - Rscript -e "inteRgrate::check_via_env(default = 'true')"
```

### Example .gitlab.yml file

```
image: rocker/r-ubuntu:18.04
variables:
  ALLOWED_WARNINGS: 0
  ALLOWED_NOTES: 0
  NO_IMPORTS: 0

before_script:
  - Rscript -e "install.packages('remotes')"
  - Rscript -e "remotes::install_github('jumpingrivers/inteRgrate')"

check:
  script:
    - Rscript -e "inteRgrate::check_via_env(default = 'true')"
```

### Command line

You can also use it at the command line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("inteRgrate")
check_pkg()
check_r_filenames()
```
